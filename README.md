Objective: 

The project aims to ease the process of purchasing home decor items for the customer using the concepts of Augmented Reality and maps API which will be embedded in an Android application.


Description of the Project:

The project aims to assist the customer to envision the look of a product in their very own house. This application will provide all the customers looking for furniture/room decor items for their room a platform where they can interact with vendors and order the items.
The customer would be able to identify his nearest vendor’s location pinned by Google Maps API plugin.
A vendor can specifically upload the image of his/her product with the price, we will be using Sceneform library to render realistic 3D scenes in AR and non-AR apps, without having to learn OpenGL.
The customer can virtually experience the look and feel of the product using the AR feature of the app which is implemented using the ARCore library (ARCore is a software development kit developed by Google that allows for augmented reality applications to be built). 
The customer would be able to place the liked articles in his/her cart and then further proceed for payment. We will be using Firebase because itThe customer can virtually experience the look and feel of the product using the AR feature of the app which is implemented using the ARCore library (ARCore is a software development kit developed by Google that allows for augmented reality applications to be built). The customer can virtually experience the look and feel of the product using the AR feature of the app which is implemented using the ARCore library (ARCore is a software development kit developed by Google that allows for augmented reality applications to be built).  supports apps which need authentication, database, file storage, analytics and server side functionality without having to own and manage infrastructure and software required for server side support.



Technologies Used:

1. Android Studio Version-3.5.3
2. Java version 1.8(Java 8)
3. Google ARCore
4. Gmaps API
5. Sceneform OpenGL ES 3.0
6. Google Firebase



Components Used:

1. Android Mobile Phone with Oreo: API Level 27: x86: Android 8.1 (Google APIs) system image.



Industrial Relevance:

The project is one of it’s kind since it uniquely shows the article via augmented reality. This product will allow the user to be also visualise the product in their very own space. This is better than the current scenario where people go and check out the product as it saves both time and effort.
